  summary: This is a unofficial fork of OpenVSLAM (https://github.com/xdspacelab/openvslam)

    The notable features are:

    It is compatible with various type of camera models and can be easily customized for other camera models.
    Created maps can be stored and loaded, then stella_vslam can localize new images based on the prebuilt maps.
    The system is fully modular. It is designed by encapsulating several functions in separated components with easy-to-understand APIs.
    We provided some code snippets to understand the core functionalities of this system.
    One of the noteworthy features of stella_vslam is that the system can deal with various type of camera models, such as perspective, fisheye, and equirectangular.
    If needed, users can implement extra camera models (e.g. dual fisheye, catadioptric) with ease. For example, visual SLAM algorithm using equirectangular camera models
    (e.g. RICOH THETA series, insta360 series, etc) is shown above.
